## The Front-End part

For the front end part of the project, we decided to use Vue.js for the following reasons:

* It provides a complete library for building user interfaces, and single page applications.
* Comparing to the alternatives (mostly React and Angular), Vue has a better learning curve, requires less code per component, and does not require us to learn any additional language or flavour.
* Vue.js is a popular framework, with a massive community and ecosystem behind it
* Vue.js supports RTL languages, making it possible to use hebrew in our project

To keep everything in the page responsive, we will use Bootstrap to wrap the project

### License

Vue is using the MIT license, which is pretty much unlimited, so thats good.
