## The Front-End part

For the front end part of the project, we decided to use Vue.js. as it provides a complete library for building
user interfaces, and single page applications.
Comparing to the alternatives (mostly React and Angular), Vue has a better learning curve, requires less code per component,
and does not require us to learn any additional language or flavour.

### License

Vue is using the MIT license, which is pretty much unlimited, so thats good.
