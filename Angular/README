although angular is very well known, and although its gallery offered many components who (allegedly) did what we expected of them,
it was very hard to get it working, we didn't manage doing it in our codepen, and also in the webstorm IDE.
we eventually found some examples that did work, but they are not very impressive.

it also requires us to learn typescript, which is an extension of javascript we simply dont have the time to study
